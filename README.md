<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Here's my solution and how I got there!

- I had a fun time building this project, is something I've already done in the past and got a change to get around to doing it again in this course!

### Built With

## Features

This Application follows pretty much all the simple math operations needed in a calculator, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide!

## How To Use

If you're seeing this thourgh the peer-review, you just need to download the zipped file and run a npm i to make sure everything is installed and npm run dev to look at it in the browser!
